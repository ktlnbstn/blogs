# blogs

This repository showcases a complete, multi-user blog webapp. Users are required to login/register an account to submit a new post, 
but are allowed to view all user's blog posts and select posts by author even.The app allows a user to submit a post which redircts 
to the main post page. User passwords are encrypted in the database for added security. Users can view their own blog pages. Users 
may delete their posts.

> It demonstrates my ability to mainpulate Flask, SQLAlchemy, and user verification and security processes. The files are broken out
into an MVC-style format.
